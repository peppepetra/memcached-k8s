  memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
  to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
  are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
  of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
  apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
  this burden across several machines.
